# Portfolio SQL
## Background
In the rapidly growing e-commerce industry, analyzing transaction data is crucial for understanding customer behavior, optimizing product offerings, and improving overall business operations. This project involves working with a comprehensive dataset from MyStore, an e-commerce platform where users can act as both buyers and sellers. The dataset consists of four main tables: '**users**', '**products**', '**orders**', and '**order_details**'. Each table contains key information that provides insights into user behavior, product performance, and transaction trends.

The following SQL queries were developed to perform various analytical tasks, including counting records, identifying top buyers, detecting inactive users, and analyzing product sales. These queries serve as foundational tools for data-driven decision-making in the e-commerce domain.

## Data Source
_MyStore dataset is_ [here](https://github.com/teguhmprayoga/portoSQL/tree/main/data)

## Objectives
1. Data Exploration and Cleaning:
   - Identify the structure and content of the products and orders tables.
   - Detect and quantify NULL or empty values within these tables to ensure data quality.
   - Determine the number of distinct product categories available in the store.
2. User Behavior Analysis:
   - Calculate the total number of users, those who have engaged in transactions as buyers, sellers, or both, and identify users who have never transacted.
   - Identify the top 5 buyers by total spending and the top 5 frequent buyers who never used discounts.
3. Transactional Insights:
   - Analyze user transaction patterns, focusing on buyers with consistent monthly transactions and high average spending.
   - Extract key transactional metrics such as monthly summaries, largest transactions, and top product categories based on sales volume.
